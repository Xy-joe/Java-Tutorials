# Introduction To Java Programming 

## My very First Repository

This is my very first repository i love this one so much because this gave birth to evey other repo on my profile. This is a simple Maths program which aids in Subraction of Numbers. The program has can be seen as a quiz which displays ten differnt qestions each requiring an answer from the user. At the end of the program it tells you how many questions you answered correctly and the time spent answering the questions. Click on the FormExamples above to view the code. Thanks
